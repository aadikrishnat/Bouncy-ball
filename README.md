# Bouncy-ball
Bouncy Ball is a small physics-based game that simulates the movement of a ball affected by gravity, collisions, and elasticity. The ball dynamically interacts with the window boundaries, bouncing around while displaying squish and squash animations to enhance realism.

## Features:
- **Gravity Simulation**: The ball is constantly pulled downward, creating a realistic falling and bouncing effect.

- **Collision Physics**: The ball collides with the window boundaries and reacts based on velocity and elasticity.

- **Squish and Squash Animation**: The ball slightly deforms (stretches and squashes) depending on the impact force, making movements more dynamic and lively.

- **Simple Controls**: If implemented, the player may interact with the ball by clicking and dragging it to move it.

## How It Works:
- **Gravity Effect**: The ball accelerates downward due to gravity.

- **Collision Handling**: When it hits the floor or walls, the velocity is adjusted to simulate a realistic `bounce`.

- **Squish and Squash**: When the ball falls and lands, it squashes to mimic impact compression. When the ball jumps or bounces off the ground, it `stretches` slightly in the direction of movement.

- **Energy Conservation**: A slight energy loss on each bounce prevents infinite bouncing, making it feel more natural.

- **Time control**: By moving the `mouse wheel` up and down, you can alter the time scale. (make it slow-motion or hyperlapse)

- **Radius Control**: While holding the ball, if you use `mouse wheel`, you can increase or decrease the radius as per your wish.

## Future Improvements (Optional Ideas):
- Add interactive elements like obstacles or moving platforms.

- Implement mouse or keyboard controls for enhanced interaction.

- Introduce different materials (e.g., rubber, metal) with varying bounce behaviors.

Enjoy bouncing! ðŸš€
